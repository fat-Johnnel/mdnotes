relation model:
- store database in simple data structures
- physical storage left up to the DBMS implementation
- Access data through high-level language,DMBS figures our best excution strategy
- **Structure**: the definition of databases's relations and their contents independent of thier physical representation
- **integity**: Ensure the databases's contents satisfy constraints
- **Manipulation**: programming interface for accessing and modifying a db's contents

relational model:primary key,uniquely identifies a sigle tuple.DBMS can auto generation unique primary keys via identit column

relation model： foreign keys

relation model: constraints:user-defined conditions that all data must obey

data manipulation languages(DML): procedual and non-procedual
and procedual language is **relational algebra**:
1. select
2. projection:generate a relation with tuples that contains only the specified attributes,it can  change thier order or can change its value
3. union : $\cup$ ,can have repeated items
4. intersection : $\cap$
5. difference: generate a relation that contains only the tuple that appears in the first and not the second of the input relations
6. product : 笛卡尔积
7. join: generate a relation that contains all tuples that are a combination of two tuples with a common values for one or more attribues.and this is the thing we are goning to optimize the most to amke them run the fastest

the relational model is independent of any query language implementation
